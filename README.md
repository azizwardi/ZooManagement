## Description  

Welcome to the Zoo Management System! This Java-based project, developed as part of a comprehensive Java course, streamlines the organization and oversight of animals within a zoo. It not only serves as a practical demonstration of key Java concepts but also provides an intuitive and efficient solution for managing zoological operations.

### Built With

* [Java](https://dev.java/)

## Features 

1. **Animal Handling:**
   - Create, display, and manage animal instances.

2. **Zoo Operations:**
   - Control animals: Add, remove, find, and view animals in the zoo effortlessly.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Resolve issues: Manage age and zoo size constraints for seamless operations.

4. **Animal Types and Behavior:**
   - Diverse animal types: Handle various classifications such as Aquatic and Terrestrial.

5. **Behavioral Actions:**
   - Unique actions: Trigger specific behaviors, e.g., swimming for aquatic animals.

6. **Interactions:**
   - Social dynamics: Manage how animals interact, play, or coexist within the zoo.

## Structure 

1. **Entities Folder (src/tn/esprit/gestionzoo/entities):**
   - Repository for key entities within the system.

2. **Enums Folder (src/tn/esprit/gestionzoo/enums):**
   - Categorization of animal diets: Meat-eaters ðŸ¥©, plant-eaters ðŸŒ±, or both ðŸ¥•.

3. **Exceptions Folder (src/tn/esprit/gestionzoo/exceptions):**
   - Exception handling: Classes addressing issues like incorrect ages or zoo full conditions.

4. **Interfaces Folder (src/tn/esprit/gestionzoo/interfaces):**
   - Definition of animal diets: Interfaces organizing animals based on their dietary needs.

5. **Main ZooManagement Folder (src/tn/esprit/gestionzoo/main/ZooManagement):**
   - The entry point of the zoo management system.

## Getting Started
